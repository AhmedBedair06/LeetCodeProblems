## Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

        for i in range(n):
            nums1.remove(0)
            
        nums1 += nums2
        nums1 = nums1.sort()
        
## The zeroes in nums1 occur as many times as the length of nums2(n) so I used for loop to remove zeroes in range of n and then merged and sorted both arrays
