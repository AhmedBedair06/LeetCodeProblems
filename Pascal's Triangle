## Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

        res = [[1]]          ##Because the first row of pascal's triangle is always [1]
         
        for i in range(numRows-1):
            temp = [0] + res[-1] + [0]    ##Added a temporary 0 to the beginning and the end of every row in order to be able to add them to the num after/before them
            row = []
            for j in range(len(res[-1])+1):  
               row.append(temp[j] + temp [j+1])  ##Added every 2 adjacent values and added results to the next row
            res.append(row)
            
        return res
