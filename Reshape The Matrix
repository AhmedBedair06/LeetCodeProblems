## You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the number of rows and the number of columns of the wanted reshaped matrix.
## The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

        mat_1d = []
        temp = []
        reshaped = []
        
        if(r*c) != (len(mat)*len(mat[0])):  ##To check if the matrix can be reshaped by given integers##
           return mat
        else:
           for i in range(len(mat)):   ##To transform original matrix to 1-dimensional form##
              mat_1d += mat[i]
           
           for j in range(r):          ##SLiced 1-dim matrix using loops with the given integers and added to final matrix##
              for k in range(c):      
                 temp.append(mat_1d[0])
                 mat_1d.remove(mat_1d[0])
              reshaped.append(temp)
              temp = []
           
           return reshaped
