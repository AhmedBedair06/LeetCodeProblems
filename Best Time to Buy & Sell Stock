## You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
   You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
   Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
   
   
        buy = 0
        sell = 1
        maxP = 0
        while sell < len(prices):
            if prices[sell]> prices[buy]:
                profit = prices[sell] - prices[buy]
                maxP = max(maxP,profit)
            else:
                buy = sell
            sell += 1
        return maxP
        
        
## Used while loop to iterate through array with the buy and sell variables representing left and right pointers
   The buy price must be lower than the selling price so the if statement makes sure that rule is applied, if a value lower than the buy price appears
   the buy price is updated to that value and the sell price keeps updating till the end of the array while checking the profit of every case.
