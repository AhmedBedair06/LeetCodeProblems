##Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.##

map = {}
       for ind,num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in map:
            return [map[diff], ind]
        map[num] = ind
        
##used hashmap to iterate through given array.
##subtracted each index from target and used if statement to search the hashmap if the difference exists.
##if it does,then the objective is complete and it returns the indices of the number and its difference with the target.
