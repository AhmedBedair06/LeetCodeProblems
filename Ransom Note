## Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.
## Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

        ransom = list(ransomNote)     ##Turned both string to list to make them mutable
        mag = list(magazine)
        temp = []                     ##Made a temporary empty list where I will attempt to contruct the ransom string
        
        for letter in ransom:
            if letter in mag:
                temp.append(letter)   ##Took every letter that is both present in ransom and mag and stored in temp
                mag.remove(letter)
                
        if temp == ransom:            ##if ransom can be constructed then it will be equal to temp
            return True
        else:
            return False
