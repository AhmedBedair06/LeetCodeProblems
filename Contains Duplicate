## Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

        purenums = list(dict.fromkeys(nums))
        if len(purenums) < len(nums):
            return True
        else:
            return False
            
## Turned array to dictionary to remove duplicates, and checked new dictionary if its length decreased in relation to old array which is a telltale sign that the array
had dupes.
