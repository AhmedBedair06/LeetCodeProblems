##Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

        s = list(s)           ##Turned s to a list to make it mutable
        temp = s[:]           ##Made a temp copy of the list s
        
        for letter in s:      
            temp.remove(letter)   ##checked every letter in s by removing it from temp and checking if it still exists
            if letter not in temp:   
                return s.index(letter)  ##If it is unique then it will not exist because I already removed it's only copy
            else:
                temp.insert(s.index(letter),letter)  ##If not it is returned to its original location
            
        return -1  ##if no character is unique or if all characters are unique
